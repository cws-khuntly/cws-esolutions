     Dear Site Owner,


     The SSL certificate for your website will be expiring on &EXPIRY_DATE .
     To ensure that the highest level of security protection continues, the certificate
     needs to be renewed prior to expiration.

     This notification is provided to allow you to :
     1. Notify all business partners of the impending certificate renewal.
     2. Schedule resources for the renewal process and coordinate with any impacted in-house systems
        such as TeaLeaf/RUM or any external systems.
     3. Verify access to the web instance access and error logs.

     IMPORTANT: If this site has 3rd party connections, please review this page.

     If the Minnetonka or RUM Support Team has been included, the certificate renewal needs to be staged with
     that group to ensure the Tea Leaf/RUM System continues to capture site info after the new certificate is applied.
     Please send all questions related to Tea Leaf to the Minnetonka Production Support Team, HTS.US.Tealeaf.Support@us.hsbc.com.
