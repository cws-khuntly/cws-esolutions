            dns information - done
            dns failover - inprog - make this optional - can turn off in config (done) - only allowed for admins, site admins
                this should be working
            create/update zone - maybe - havent decided yet. the shell scripts can handle it, and maybe it should stay that way ?
            dns role swap
            dns decommission
        intranet
            dns information - done
            dns failover - not started (global dispatch) - make this optional - can turn off in config (done sortof)
                scripting required for this. isnt even in the dns util yet. definitely wont be like it is for internet.
